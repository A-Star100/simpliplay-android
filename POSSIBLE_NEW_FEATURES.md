Since I'm too tired to update this app anymore and I want to relax for a while. (You can add these features and then [contribute back](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-android/blob/contrib/contrib/README.md))

# Possible New Features
1. Use Media3 instead of ExoPlayer2 (It's really annoying to migrate once you've settled in).
2. Add support for files in playlists.
3. Make sure that icons adapt to light and dark mode (whatever I try doesn't work).
4. Make the app more lightweight. Right now, it's not the most lightweight or most fast video player app in the world.
5. Maybe, revamp the Flutter app to use flutter_vlc_player instead of video_player & chewie, because the current combination has many bugs to the point where normally unnecessary modifications needed to be made.
6. Add support for URLs and files (as well as a wakelock) for the Kotlin Media3 demo (for that, please contribute [here](https://github.com/akhorasani/Media3Player), as the demo here is only a simple modification of that project.
7. Make the UI more intuitive, right now it is a tiny bit clunky.
